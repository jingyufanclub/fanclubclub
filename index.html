    <h1>JING</h1>
    <p>I’m growing my hair out long like a mermaid and as such feel a deep, intuitive affinity with the ocean. I am inspired by Lucas Wolenczak, the teenaged genius who attended my alma mater played by Jonathan Brandis on the television series seaQuest DSV. Jonathan was my favorite teen idol of the mid-90s. I liked him better than Joey Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio. There’s a Free Kitten song that goes “He would love me I can tell cos he is deeper than any well,” and I always thought that nobody understood him quite like I did. I mean, if only he had my love, maybe he wouldn’t have committed suicide.</p>
